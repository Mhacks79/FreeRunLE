// Havok.h - ray casts and shape casts against the physics world.
//
// The parkour system is a physics query first and an animation system second:
// every ledge, vault and headroom test here is a cast into the Havok world.
//
// Special Edition builds an hkpCollidable by hand and hands it to
// hkpWorld::linearCast. This edition can do the same, but almost nothing about
// the surrounding types matches: the hit records are laid out differently (the
// collidable of the object you hit is at +0x28, not +0x24, which the engine's
// own collector-fill at 0x00D57960 settles), the capsule shape is built by a
// single constructor that scales to Havok itself, and the ray pick takes its
// all-hits collector in a different slot of the pick data.
