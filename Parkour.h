// Parkour.h - finding a ledge, deciding what it is, and starting the action.
//
// Every frame the player's animation graph ticks, the ledge in front of them is
// looked for again: a forward probe from head height, a downward probe where it
// clears, then a series of tests that ask whether a body could actually go
// there - headroom above the ledge, a gap behind it, a clear line from the
// player to it, and the state the player is in.
//
// The result is one of the ParkourType values below. It is written into the
// behaviour's own graph variable, the behaviour picks the matching animation,
// and the animation's root motion does the moving. The plugin only nudges the
// player onto the starting mark the animation expects.
