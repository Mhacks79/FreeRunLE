// Freerun LE
//
// A parkour framework for Skyrim Legendary Edition: climb the ledge in front of
// you, vault what is waist high, catch an edge in mid-air, slide out of a
// sprint, roll out of a fall.
//
// This is a port of SkyParkour NG by Tsptds, whose source is licensed under the
// AGPLv3; this port is released under the same licence. The behaviour patch, the
// animations and the interface come from that project.
//
// What the port had to rebuild rather than carry over:
//
//   * Every engine call. Special Edition's plugin is written against
//     CommonLibSSE and the Address Library; neither exists here, and this
//     edition's engine is a different build with different structures, so every
//     address, offset and vtable slot in Engine.h was read out of the 1.9.32.0
//     executable and is annotated with the evidence.
//
//   * The physics queries. The hit records come back in a different order (the
//     collidable of the thing you hit sits four bytes further along), the
//     capsule shape is built by a single constructor that scales into Havok
//     itself, and the ray pick takes its all-hits collector in a different slot.
//
//   * The heartbeat. The mod ticks from a channel bound into the player's
//     animation graph. Special Edition's poll takes a bool; this edition's takes
//     no argument at all, and the manager is not an event sink here, so the
//     player's own sink is what the animation events are read from.
//
//   * The settings. The SKSE Menu Framework does not exist on this edition, so
//     the settings live in an INI and the in-game menu is a SkyUI mod
//     configuration menu driven through Papyrus.
//
//   * The camera, input and control-map work, which all sit at different
//     offsets and, in two cases, answer a better question than the original
//     asked (see the notes in Parkour.cpp and Slide.cpp).
